This project is a simple All-NBA projection model completed 5 years ago - prior to having any NBA (or other full-time) data science experience.

This model took into account position, age, and box score statistics in order to determine how many All NBA selections a player had remaining. 

While it did a good job of projecting the success of some future stars (Doncic - 11 All NBA selections remaining at the time), it likely also overexaggerated the decline of others (Curry - 1 All NBA selection remaining at the time), and would have benefitted from some more advanced metrics being included in the regression.
